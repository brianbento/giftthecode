## Gift Of Code 2017 - Indspire Youth Engagement Challenge

The Indspire Engagement Portal is an online platform to provide motivation for Soaring Conference attendees to interact with different activities and aspects of the conference.

Attendees are awarded points throughout the conference by performing various actions. These points are awarded by having vendors/organizers scan an attendees QR Code, or entering their unique code. These points are then used by the attendee to obtain free swag or enter draws for prizes.

Through an admin portal, organizers can create, edit and delete information for users, awards and redemption items. A mobile friendly scanner web app is included for vendors and organizers to award and redeem points. 

All data is housed internally and no personal information is stored to protect the identity of attendees.
